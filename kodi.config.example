# Unset the following to disable deeper searches on generic play commands.
# By default, if you ask to play media without specifying the type, the skill
# will search through the entire library to find a match.
#
# For example, if you ask, "Alexa, ask Kodi to play ninety nine red balloons,"
# the skill will search library items in the following order to find the song:
#
#   Movies -> Shows -> Artists -> Songs -> Albums
#
# If your library is really large, this can take some time to complete.  While
# it will eventually execute, Alexa may report that the skill timed out.  If
# this behavior bothers you, you can disable deep searches.
#
# When disabled, Alexa will simply provide help in the response directing you
# to issue a play command that includes the media type of the item.

# Your local time zone for responses that include absolute times.
# See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
# For example, if you are in the Eastern US time zone, you would use:
# timezone=US/Eastern
# Leave empty or undefined (commented out) if you don't need or want absolute
# time responses.  An example is asking when the currently playing item will
# end.  If you have SKILL_TZ defined, it will also tell you the wall-clock
# time when the item will conclude.
